__ERR_NEGATION__.
_int_—(_Incoherent_) an error code usually received during
e-mail conversations, when a dialog partner wants the exact thing, that was
declared irrelevant, harmful or impossible in the previous e-mail. This code
appears with high probability, if the previous e-mail ended with “We should
definitively _not_ do Thing!”, and is introduced by the words “Alright, let’s
do Thing then!”.

_Attention!_ This error code can severly damage work enthusiasm!
