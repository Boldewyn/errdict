        <strong>ERR_TIMEOUT</strong>.
        <em>int</em>—(<em>Excl</em>) an error code usually received during
        e-mail conversations, when a dialog partner fails to deliver necessary
        information for a project for some time, only to rush for immediate
        execution when finally producing said information.
      <p>
        This error appears with accuracy, when the withholding partner has an
        implicit deadline (perceived or real), that the other one knows nothing
        about. See also <em>time management</em> and <em>Do you think I have no
        other customers?</em>.
