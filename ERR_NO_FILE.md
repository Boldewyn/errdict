__ERR_NO_FILE__.
_int_—(_Searching_) an error code usually received during
e-mail conversations, when a dialog partner refers to a missing
attachment. In many cases this error appears twice in close succession.

Applying Murphy’s Law yields, that this error code appears more
probably, the more important the attachment is to the content of the
remaining e-mail.
