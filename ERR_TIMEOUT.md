__ERR_TIMEOUT__.
_int_â€”(_Excl_) an error code usually received during
e-mail conversations, when a dialog partner fails to deliver necessary
information for a project for some time, only to rush for immediate
execution when finally producing said information.

This error appears with accuracy, when the withholding partner has an
implicit deadline (perceived or real), that the other one knows nothing
about. See also _time management_ and _Do you think I have no other customers?_.
