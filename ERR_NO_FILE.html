        <strong>ERR_NO_FILE</strong>.
        <em>int</em>—(<em>Searching</em>) an error code usually received during
        e-mail conversations, when a dialog partner refers to a missing
        attachment. In many cases this error appears twice in close succession.
      <p>
        Applying Murphy’s Law yields, that this error code appears more
        probably, the more important the attachment is to the content of the
        remaining e-mail.
