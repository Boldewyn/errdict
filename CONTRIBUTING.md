# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your suggestion to extend the dictionary!

## The Scope _&_ Tone of Error Codes

These texts are meant to elucidate common patterns in human-to-human e-mail
communication and to do so in a light and funny way. While sometimes using
strong words, entries may never be harming, destructive or in any other way
carry _ad hominem_ insults. Some of the pictured actions and reactions are
already emotionally loaded, when appearing in real life. All the more it is
important to write an entry about them in a clear, calm and embracing tone.

This is a fine line. When for example
[ERR_INSUFFICIENT_INPUT](ERR_INSUFFICIENT_INPUT) reads _“Read the whole damn
mail!”_, this might be interpreted as against the previous paragraph. But on
closer inspection it pictures the immediate and intimate reaction of the
receiving user, which may in fact help the culprit to better understand, what
is the problem.

## Adding an Error Code

Dictionary entries have a certain structure, that should be respected. While
this isn’t cast in stone, please deviate only, if there is a specific reason
to.

> __ERR_ALL_CAPS__.
> _int_—(_Mood for error_) then verbatim: “an error code usually received
> during e-mail conversations, when a dialog partner”, followed by the action
> of said partner. Any circumstances, in which the error occurs.
>
> Any consequences of the error.
> See also _generic term_ and _My personal reaction!_.

description of the change request meaningful and explain, why the entry
should be added to the dictionary.
