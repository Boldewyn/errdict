__ERR_PARSE_FAILURE__.
_int_â€”(_Despairing_) an error code usually received during
e-mail conversations, when a dialog partner utters incoherent data
that has virtually nothing to do with the topic of the previous e-mail
or the overall conversation.

If this error code appears regularly, might turn the dialog partner
into a green muscular raging monster.
